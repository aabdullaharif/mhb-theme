It means spending a few extra minutes and cents on that truly exquisite cup of coffee, pint of beer, or glass of Willamette pinot you won’t find anywhere but here. It’s live music in ballrooms and basements, 9 pm sunsets over forested hills, and double decker bikes cruising riverside lanes. It’s zoobombing, cat cafés, soapbox derbies, street fairs, brightly painted houses, and tiny parks and green spaces hidden around corners and tucked between buildings.<\/span><\/p>",

Portland’s main streets are plentiful and woven between and through her blocks of colorful houses and parks and bike racks and apartments and libraries.

I’ve heard of fellow small retailers down 20, 30, even 50 percent this summer in comparison with years past. For most of us, there’s a timeline – a number of months we can continue to make little or no profit without being beaten, spiritually, financially, or both. The larger the company, the longer this timeline: fatter cats can wait longer between meals. Indeed, the biggest national and multinational companies can wait us all out many times over. And the clock is ticking. But if time runs out for Portland’s small businesses, then our city will be changed forever, empty of so much of what made it different and special and, yes, weird. <\/span><\/p>",

We employ and provide benefits to your friends and neighbors and care about their fulfillment and development as employees and people. And we offer something you won’t get anywhere but Portland.

Our small size is on purpose: it allows us to hone more focused talents and nurture more authentic passions to share them with you, our customers, our fellow Portlanders.
