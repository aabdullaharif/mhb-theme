Who know how to say \"You ain't seen nothing yet\" in seven languages, and would rather be skinny dipping at midnight. We're for her and for him and for them, and for all who love themselves, and each other, exactly how they are. And for learning and growing and failing and celebrating at every step of the way. Because real life happens in the outtakes, not when it's staged. You may have even heard (it's true): We really, really care.<\/p><p>When you shop Betsy &amp; Iya, we hope you see the care in every bend of the wire, in every hammer stroke, in every blast of the torch.  We hope you see deliberation and perpendicularity. We hope you love the other artists’ and designers’ products we carry just as much as we do.  We hope you feel amazing and gush confidence.  And then we hope someone does something silly and that we all crack up for a while. Thanks for stopping by, for saying hello. <strong>We're so glad you're here.<\/strong><\/p>",
